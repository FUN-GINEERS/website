<br /><br />Dear all.
<br /><br />We sincerely apologize for the issues and downtime with our server over the week. We have suffered a double catastrophic failure on both the primary and the backup drives that cause recovery to be difficult. We have done everything in our means to recover from the situation, including sending the drives to professional data recovery experts. This took a couple of days. Unfortunately the media was heavily damaged and that proved to be fruitless. However we have seen found another backup and is attempting to recover data from it. This has taken the last 3 days. At this point, it is looking good that we will have data to restore from. If everything goes to plan, we should be able to start restoring data by this evening.
<br /><br />cp2 has already been reinstalled, and is awaiting the outcome of the drive recovery. Once we have the recovered data, we will start working on them without delay.
<br /><br />Moving forward, we will also like to assure you that a thorough review of our backup and redundancy plans have been undertaken, and we will be proceeding to work on them right after we are past this emergency. Among the changes, we are investing in a whole new set of hardware, including raid redundancy. We will also work on adding more layers of backups.
<br /><br />Once again, we apologize for the delays and long downtime and appreciate your support.
<br /><br />Best Regards,

<br /><br />Dear Sir/Madam,
<br /><br />As you are probably aware, we have experienced a major server failure that resulted in massive breakdown of the cp2 server with both Hard Drives getting damaged. With the help of professional IT engineers a diagnosis has been made and a resolution to recover the data in the failed hard drives is on its way. As unfortunate as the incidence is and most importantly the undesired outome it yielded for you and for us <b>the good news is that the recovery is under way and the resolution is only a couple of days away.</b> Please be assured that your accounts and files will be available for you very soon, just be a little more patient and we will be certain to reward your understanding and patience.
<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />ShieldHost Management</p>
